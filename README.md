# contact-center-android

This project is a demo application for Build Your Contact Center guide. 


To run it, open `NetworkClient.kt`

1. Have `getBaseUrl()` returning the base url of the server you work with. For example `https://xxxxxx.herokuapp.com/`

2. Have `getMobileApiKey()` returning the mobile API key provided by the demo app. It can be found in `SDK Integration page`, as a rudimentary security mechanism.
